# vuejs-health-app

For the majority of my life, I was in bad shape. I ate whatever I wanted, went to the gym a few times a month (maybe) and that was my existence.

But back in 2017, enough was enough. I got my act together and ended up losing over 70 pounds. Since then, I've become more and more interested in what it means to be healthy. Most people picture a salad and some dumbbells when they think of health. But through my research, I've realized that there's more to it than that. So I built an app that will help a user enter and track what I've defined as the four main areas of good health: Sleep, Movement, Nutrition, and Stress Management.

At the end of each day, the user inputs their hours of sleep the night prior, their step count, their calorie count, and how they'd rate their stress management for the day. Based on those inputs, they are given a score out of 10 as well as their Daily Score, which is the culmination of their four scores for that day. I've also included graphs that pull the user's inputs for the four areas directly from the database so they can get a sense of how they've been doing.

The user also begins each Daily Report by entering in something they are grateful for. There is mounting research that being mindful of your gratitudes can help increase happiness, so I wanted to incorporate that. As the user interacts with the app more and more, they are able to see their list of gratitudes grow.

I built this app to help people stay mindful of these four paramount areas of their daily health. I built the front-end using VueJS and utilized TrendJS for the graphs. I built the back-end in Rails.
